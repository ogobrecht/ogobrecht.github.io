      <description>Earlier this year I wrote at the end of this post:
 P.S.: In the meantime I switched complete to Markdown and Jekyll, a static site generator - but this is another story for another post &amp;hellip;
 As always - it took a bit longer then expected. In the meantime I was fiddling around with Jekyll and modifying the default theme Minima to my needs. Then I stumbled over the JSDoc theme Minami and the Liquid docs site - both with nice sidebars.</description>

      <description>Today I stumbled over this strange behaviour of an APEX page: The page was always submitted when I pressed the enter key in a search field to force an AJAX refresh on a report.
The item property to submit the page on pressing enter was switched off. I asked my collegue Markus, who had this error also some time ago (I could not remember the solution, although he told me about this issue).</description>
