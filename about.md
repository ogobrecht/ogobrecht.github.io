Hi, my name is Ottmar Gobrecht. I am a database developer working with Oracle PL/SQL & APEX and this is my private homepage/blog.

I live and work in Munich, Germany and I am a little bit active in open source development - you can find my projects on [GitHub][1] and of course [here on this site][2].

This site is built with [Jekyll][3], a static site generator, and a slightly modified version of the default theme minima. The sources are available in this [GitHub repository][4].
