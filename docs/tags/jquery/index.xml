      <description>Maxime Tremblay has already described here how to customize the datepicker.
He had to deal with missing classes after changing options. I found this week a different way to customize the datepicker without loosing classes added by APEX: Simply by setting datepicker defaults on page load before any datepicker is initialized.
In my case I wanted to enable the button panel which shows two buttons - one to go to the current month which is called Today and a second one to close the datepicker which is called Done I only wanted the today button, so I had to provide beside the JavaScript or dynamic action some CSS to hide the second one:</description>

      <description>SVG based charts and visualizations are often used these days. But what if you want to use your browser inline SVGs, generated with some sort of JavaScript and fancy styled with CSS, offline - maybe in a presentation, send by email or printed out large scaled?
You can create a screenshot, of course. But does this look nice when it comes to scaling? You can try to copy the HTML code of the SVG and wrap it into a correct SVG container, but then you will loose in the most cases the stylings, as normally not all CSS definitions are directly attached to the SVG elements.</description>
