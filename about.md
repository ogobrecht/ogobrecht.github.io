Hi, my name is Ottmar Gobrecht. I am a database developer working with Oracle PL/SQL & APEX and this is my private homepage.

I live in Munich, Germany and I am a little bit active in open source development - you can find my projects on [GitHub][1] and of course [here on this site][2].

As declared in the [privacy statement][3] I use no user tracking at all. I am enjoying my own private times without distractions and therefore I have no discussion possibility here on this site. The preferred way to get in contact with me is to send me an email (<a href="mailto:{{ site.email }}">{{ site.email }}</a>) or in urgent cases a postcard.

If love postcards. If you enjoyed some content here on this site and you want to give me a treat - send a postcard to:

Ottmar Gobrecht  
Knappertsbuschstraße 19  
81927 München (Germany)

This site is built with [Jekyll][4], a static site generator, and a slightly modified version of the default theme minima. The sources are [available at GitHub][5].
