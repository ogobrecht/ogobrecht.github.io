## Privacy Notice

I don't use any user tracking. This site is hosted on GitHub's infrastructure. I can't access their web server log files for my site and if I could, I would not be interested on it.

Since end of January 2017 I use the [Disqus][1] service only for posts, NOT on index pages like the home page, the archive or this imprint page. I switched off the tracking option in the Disqus configuration for my site. So, you should only be "tracked" by the session cookie when you are logged into the Disqus service and able to comment. Disqus is supporting the ["Do Not Track"][2] setting in your browser, so you can opt out by configuring your browser settings. See also this [Disqus help page][3].
