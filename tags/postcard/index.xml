      <description>Maybe you already saw my footer and were wondering about the postcard comments. I love postcards and thought it would be nice to get postcards from people who enjoyed some of my posts or open source projects.
After a while I thought no one would do this these days - it is easier to send an email than a postcard.
But just before Christmas the first postcard arrived. Oliver Gorwits from the United Kingdom is using my D3 force-directed network chart in one of his own projects and has sent me a nice postcard.</description>
