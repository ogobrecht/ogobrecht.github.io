Maybe you already saw my footer and were wondering about the postcard comments. I love postcards and thought it would be nice to get postcards from people who enjoyed some of my posts or open source projects.

After a while I thought no one would do this these days - it is easier to send an email than a postcard.

But just before Christmas the first postcard arrived. [Oliver Gorwits][1] from the United Kingdom is using my [D3 force-directed network chart][2] in one of [his own projects][3] and has sent me a nice postcard. THANK YOU Oliver, this sort of feedback keeps me motivated :-)

I asked him if I am allowed to publish a picture of his postcard - for Oliver it is ok. I can only show you the back side because of copyright reasons - if you are interested in how the front side looks like, do a short internet search for `'Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom', Andy Warhol, 1985` or use this [Google image link][4].

Happy new year to all :-)
